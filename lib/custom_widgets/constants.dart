  static const String aboutUsDescription="Sophia High School, situated on 70, Palace Road, Bangalore is an all girls, Catholic institution founded in 1949 by Mother Andersson of the Religious Order of the Sacred Heart. Since 1972, the school has been run by the Sisters of Notre Dame under the Barat Society and is placed under the patronage of Mary, Mother of Jesus. Situated in the sylvan surroundings of central Bangalore, Sophia High School is one of the finest examples of premier English education in the city. Founded in January 1949, Sophia is enriched by the patronage of two saintly religious women; St Madeline Sophie Barat, and St. Julie Billiart, the founders of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart and the Sisters of Notre Dame respectively.Sophia firmly believes that all students be recognised as individuals in their own right, who must be granted the opportunity to evolve personally and academically in a supportive environment. In addition to striving for excellence in academics, the school also seeks to impart a strong sense of personal integrity and fundamental values to our students. We believe that we are responsible for facilitating the growth of well-adjusted individuals who are assets to the various personal and professional communities that they belong to. Towards this, we inculcate in our students personal and professional well-being, wisdom, excellence and compassion. Consequently, we send forth young women with a profound capacity for giving, sensitivity and the ability to respond empathetically to the social realities of their times. Affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE), Sophia prepares students to appear for the ICSE examinations at the high school (class 10) level and for the ISC examinations at the pre-university (plus two) level. The medium of instruction is English and high school students can choose to study either Hindi, Kannada or French as a second language. Students enrolled in the ISC programme may choose one of three streams of study: Arts, Commerce or Science.";
